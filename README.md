# VHoppAS: Variable-range Hopping in Amorphous Solids
Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation of 3D variable-range hopping of localized electrons in amorphous compounds, which yields the conductivity (and diffusion coefficients) based on a user-supplied density of states (e.g. from an ab-initio DOS).

This code was developed by Philipp Hein at the Institute of Physical Chemistry, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, under the supervision of Prof. Manfred Martin.

## Features
- Randomized 3D positions and energies of localized states generated from an arbitrary user-supplied DOS
- Flexible cut-off definitions for DOS energy range, hop distance and hop energy (incl. auto-adjustment)
- Initial electron distribution: Fermi-Dirac or step function
- Multi-stage simulations with equilibration and repetitions for improved statistics
- Electron transport with and without electric field
- Validation of the Nernst-Einstein relation
- Calculation of the partial entropy of electrons
- Facile parameter studies, e.g. of temperature, chemical potential or electric field (optimized for parallel submission to cluster systems)
- Optional fit of the electron distribution for effective temperature and effective chemical potential (e.g. at high electric field strength)
- Detection of oscillations
- Extensive statistics (incl. detailed histograms)
- _and more_
