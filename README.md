# VHoppAS: Variable-range Hopping in Amorphous Solids
DOS-based kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation of 3D variable-range hopping for conductivity and diffusion coefficients of electrons in amorphous compounds.

This code was developed by Philipp Hein at the Institute of Physical Chemistry, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, under the supervision of Prof. Manfred Martin.

## Features
- Randomized 3D positions and energies of localized states generated from an arbitrary user-supplied DOS
- Flexible cut-off definitions for DOS energy range, hop distance and hop energy (incl. auto-adjustment)
- Initial electron distribution: Fermi-Dirac or step function
- Multi-stage simulations with equilibration and repetitions for improved statistics
- Electron transport with and without electric field
- Validation of the Nernst-Einstein relation
- Calculation of the partial entropy of electrons
- Facile parameter studies, e.g. of temperature, chemical potential or electric field (optimized for parallel submission to cluster systems)
- Optional fit of the electron distribution for effective temperature and effective chemical potential (e.g. at high electric field strength)
- Detection of oscillations
- Extensive statistics (incl. detailed histograms)
- _and more_
